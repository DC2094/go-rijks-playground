This lil app will be a playground for levelling up fmy SQL / Postgres skillset.

The plan is to gather data from the rijks [harvest](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/harvest/) api. How quickly 
can I harvest it all?

Store this is a local postgres instance

Create a some queries on the data

That's likely all I will do. I might add some functions to get to know go iterators. 

Perhaps once the data is all here I will explore a grpc server & client to interact with the DB. Who knows...
